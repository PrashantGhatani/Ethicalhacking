Nmap Advanced Cheat Sheet

Basic Scanning Techniques:
---------------------------
1. Scan single target: 
   nmap [target] 
   # Replace [target] with the IP address or hostname of the target machine.

2. Scan multiple targets:
   nmap [target1] [target2] [target3] ...
   # You can specify multiple targets separated by spaces.

3. Scan entire subnet:
   nmap [subnet] 
   # Replace [subnet] with the CIDR notation for the subnet (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

4. Scan multiple subnets:
   nmap [subnet1] [subnet2] [subnet3] ...
   # You can specify multiple subnets separated by spaces.

5. Scan specific ports:
   nmap -p [ports] [target] 
   # Replace [ports] with a comma-separated list of port numbers or port ranges.

6. Scan all ports:
   nmap -p- [target] 
   # This scans all 65535 ports.

7. TCP SYN Scan (Stealth Scan):
   nmap -sS [target] 
   # Uses SYN packets to determine open ports without establishing a full connection.

8. TCP Connect Scan:
   nmap -sT [target] 
   # Performs a full TCP connection to each port.

9. UDP Scan:
   nmap -sU [target] 
   # Scans for open UDP ports.

Advanced Techniques:
--------------------
10. OS Detection:
    nmap -O [target] 
    # Attempts to determine the operating system of the target.

11. Service Version Detection:
    nmap -sV [target] 
    # Attempts to determine the version of services running on open ports.

12. Aggressive Scan:
    nmap -A [target] 
    # Enables OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

13. TCP ACK Scan:
    nmap -sA [target] 
    # Determines if ports are filtered or unfiltered.

14. TCP Window Scan:
    nmap -sW [target] 
    # Determines if ports are open, closed, or filtered.

15. TCP NULL Scan:
    nmap -sN [target] 
    # Sends TCP packets with no flags set.

16. TCP FIN Scan:
    nmap -sF [target] 
    # Sends TCP packets with only the FIN flag set.

17. TCP Xmas Scan:
    nmap -sX [target] 
    # Sends TCP packets with the FIN, PSH, and URG flags set.

Output Options:
----------------
18. Save results to file:
    nmap -oN [filename] [target] 
    # Saves results in normal format to the specified file.

19. Save results in XML format:
    nmap -oX [filename.xml] [target] 
    # Saves results in XML format to the specified file.

20. Save results in grepable format:
    nmap -oG [filename.txt] [target] 
    # Saves results in grepable format to the specified file.

Miscellaneous:
---------------
21. Disable DNS resolution:
    nmap -n [target] 
    # Disables DNS resolution for faster scanning.

22. Enable aggressive timing:
    nmap -T4 [target] 
    # Sets timing template to aggressive.

23. Perform a fast scan:
    nmap -F [target] 
    # Scans only the most common ports.

24. Increase verbosity:
    nmap -v [target] 
    # Increases verbosity level for more detailed output.

25. Use a specific network interface:
    nmap -e [interface] [target] 
    # Specifies the network interface to use.

26. Use a decoy IP:
    nmap -D RND:10 [target] 
    # Adds decoy IPs to hide the true source of the scan.

27. Scan using IPv6:
    nmap -6 [target] 
    # Performs the scan using IPv6.

28. Disable ping:
    nmap -Pn [target] 
    # Disables ICMP echo requests.

29. Scan using a proxy:
    nmap --proxy [proxy_address:port] [target] 
    # Performs the scan through a proxy server.

30. Perform a stealth scan:
    nmap -sS -Pn -n -T4 --spoof-mac [MAC_address] [target] 
    # Performs a stealth scan with various options to avoid detection.
